# fuelanchor
A CKEditor plugin for use with FUEL CMS to expose 'anchor' functionality

### Installation
Insert into the plugins directory for your CKEditor install at ./fuel/modules/fuel/assets/js/editors/ckeditor/plugins

## Note
As of writing, the 'fuelimage' plugin has a bug which interferes with this plugin. A report has been made upstream but in the meantime you may want to check my forum post on the subject at:
